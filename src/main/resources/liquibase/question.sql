  'Chronobiology might sound a little futuristic – like something from a science
fiction novel, perhaps – but it’s actually a field of study that concerns one of the oldest
processes life on this planet has ever known: short-term rhythms of time and their effect
on flora and fauna.
This can take many forms. Marine life, for example, is influenced by tidal
patterns. Animals tend to be active or inactive depending on the position of the sun or
moon. Numerous creatures, humans included, are largely diurnal – that is, they like to
come out during the hours of sunlight. Nocturnal animals, such as bats and possums,
prefer to forage by night. A third group are known as crepuscular: they thrive in the low-
light of dawn and dusk and remain inactive at other hours.
When it comes to humans, chronobiologists are interested in what is known as
the circadian rhythm. This is the complete cycle our bodies are naturally geared to
undergo within the passage of a twenty-four hour day. Aside from sleeping at night and
waking during the day, each cycle involves many other factors such as changes in blood
pressure and body temperature. Not everyone has an identical circadian rhythm. ‘Night
people’, for example, often describe how they find it very hard to operate during the
morning, but become alert and focused by evening. This is a benign variation within
circadian rhythms known as a chronotype.
Scientists have limited abilities to create durable modifications of
chronobiological demands. Recent therapeutic developments for humans such as
artificial light machines and melatonin administration can reset our circadian rhythms, for
example, but our bodies can tell the difference and health suffers when we breach these
natural rhythms for extended periods of time. Plants appear no more malleable in this
2respect; studies demonstrate that vegetables grown in season and ripened on the tree
are far higher in essential nutrients than those grown in greenhouses and ripened by
laser.
Knowledge of chronobiological patterns can have many pragmatic implications
for our day-to-day lives. While contemporary living can sometimes appear to subjugate
biology – after all, who needs circadian rhythms when we have caffeine pills, energy
drinks, shift work and cities that never sleep? – keeping in synch with our body clock is
important.
The average urban resident, for example, rouses at the eye-blearing time of 6.04
a.m., which researchers believe to be far too early. One study found that even rising at
7.00 a.m. has deleterious effects on health unless exercise is performed for 30 minutes
afterward. The optimum moment has been whittled down to 7.22 a.m.; muscle aches,
headaches and moodiness were reported to be lowest by participants in the study who
awoke then.
Once you’re up and ready to go, what then? If you’re trying to shed some extra
pounds, dieticians are adamant: never skip breakfast. This disorients your circadian
rhythm and puts your body in starvation mode. The recommended course of action is to
follow an intense workout with a carbohydrate-rich breakfast; the other way round and
weight loss results are not as pronounced.
Morning is also great for breaking out the vitamins. Supplement absorption by the
body is not temporal-dependent, but naturopath Pam Stone notes that the extra boost at
breakfast helps us get energised for the day ahead. For improved absorption, Stone
suggests pairing supplements with a food in which they are soluble and steering clear of
caffeinated beverages. Finally, Stone warns to take care with storage; high potency is
best for absorption, and warmth and humidity are known to deplete the potency of a
supplement.
After-dinner espressos are becoming more of a tradition – we have the Italians to
thank for that – but to prepare for a good night’s sleep we are better off putting the
brakes on caffeine consumption as early as 3 p.m. With a seven hour half-life, a cup of
coffee containing 90 mg of caffeine taken at this hour could still leave 45 mg of caffeine
in your nervous system at ten o’clock that evening. It is essential that, by the time you
are ready to sleep, your body is rid of all traces.
Evenings are important for winding down before sleep; however, dietician
Geraldine Georgeou warns that an after-five carbohydrate-fast is more cultural myth
than chronobiological demand. This will deprive your body of vital energy needs.
Overloading your gut could lead to indigestion, though. Our digestive tracts do not shut
down for the night entirely, but their work slows to a crawl as our bodies prepare for
sleep. Consuming a modest snack should be entirely sufficient.',

-- Question2

insert into question_bank values('Q00017',3,'The first of our three brains to evolve is what scientists call the reptilian cortex. This brain\nsustains the elementary activities of animal survival such as respiration, adequate rest\nand a beating heart. We are not required to consciously “think” about these activities.\nThe reptilian cortex also houses the “startle centre”, a mechanism that facilitates swift\nreactions to unexpected occurrences in our surroundings. That panicked lurch you\nexperience when a door slams shut somewhere in the house, or the heightened\nawareness you feel when a twig cracks in a nearby bush while out on an evening stroll\nare both examples of the reptilian cortex at work. When it comes to our interaction with\nothers, the reptilian brain offers up only the most basic impulses: aggression, mating,\nand territorial defence. There is no great difference, in this sense, between a crocodile\ndefending its spot along the river and a turf war between two urban gangs.\nAlthough the lizard may stake a claim to its habitat, it exerts total indifference toward the\nwell-being of its young. Listen to the anguished squeal of a dolphin separated from its\npod or witness the sight of elephants mourning their dead, however, and it is clear that a\nnew development is at play. Scientists have identified this as the limbic cortex. Unique to\nmammals, the limbic cortex impels creatures to nurture their offspring by delivering\nfeelings of tenderness and warmth to the parent when children are nearby. These same\nsensations also cause mammals to develop various types of social relations and kinship\nnetworks. When we are with others of “our kind” – be it at soccer practice, church,\nschool or a nightclub – we experience positive sensations of togetherness, solidarity and\ncomfort. If we spend too long away from these networks, then loneliness sets in and\nencourages us to seek companionship.\nOnly human capabilities extend far beyond the scope of these two cortexes. Humans\neat, sleep and play, but we also speak, plot, rationalise and debate finer points of\nmorality. Our unique abilities are the result of an expansive third brain – the neocortex –which engages with logic, reason and ideas. The power of the neocortex comes from its\nability to think beyond the present, concrete moment. While other mammals are mainly\nrestricted to impulsive actions (although some, such as apes, can learn and remember\nsimple lessons), humans can think about the “big picture”. We can string together simple\nlessons (for example, an apple drops downwards from a tree; hurting others causes\nunhappiness) to develop complex theories of physical or social phenomena (such as the\nlaws of gravity and a concern for human rights).\nThe neocortex is also responsible for the process by which we decide on and commit to\nparticular courses of action. Strung together over time, these choices can accumulate\ninto feats of progress unknown to other animals. Anticipating a better grade on the\nfollowing morning’s exam, a student can ignore the limbic urge to socialise and go to\nsleep early instead. Over three years, this ongoing sacrifice translates into a first class\ndegree and a scholarship to graduate school; over a lifetime, it can mean ground-\nbreaking contributions to human knowledge and development. The ability to sacrifice our\ndrive for immediate satisfaction in order to benefit later is a product of the neocortex.\nUnderstanding the triune brain can help us appreciate the different natures of brain\ndamage and psychological disorders. The most devastating form of brain damage, for\nexample, is a condition in which someone is understood to be brain dead. In this state a\nperson appears merely unconscious – sleeping, perhaps – but this is illusory. Here, the\nreptilian brain is functioning on autopilot despite the permanent loss of other cortexes.\nDisturbances to the limbic cortex are registered in a different manner. Pups with limbic\ndamage can move around and feed themselves well enough but do not register the\npresence of their littermates. Scientists have observed how, after a limbic lobotomy 2 ,\n“one impaired monkey stepped on his outraged peers as if treading on a log or a rock”.\nIn our own species, limbic damage is closely related to sociopathic behaviour.\nSociopaths in possession of fully-functioning neocortexes are often shrewd and\nemotionally intelligent people but lack any ability to relate to, empathise with or express\nconcern for others.\nOne of the neurological wonders of history occurred when a railway worker named\nPhineas Gage survived an incident during which a metal rod skewered his skull, taking a\nconsiderable amount of his neocortex with it. Though Gage continued to live and work\nas before, his fellow employees observed a shift in the equilibrium of his personality.\nGage’s animal propensities were now sharply pronounced while his intellectual abilities\nsuffered; garrulous or obscene jokes replaced his once quick wit. New findings suggest,\nhowever, that Gage managed to soften these abrupt changes over time and rediscover\nan appropriate social manner. This would indicate that reparative therapy has the\npotential to help patients with advanced brain trauma to gain an improved quality of life.',null,'2017-12-19 19:58:20','2017-12-19 19:58:20','admin','admin','READING-IELTS',null);

-- Question 3
  insert into question_bank values (
  'Q00033',
  3,
  'A
In recent years we have all been exposed to dire media reports concerning the
impending demise of global coal and oil reserves, but the depletion of another key non-
renewable resource continues without receiving much press at all. Helium – an inert,
odourless, monatomic element known to lay people as the substance that makes
balloons float and voices squeak when inhaled – could be gone from this planet within a
generation.
B
Helium itself is not rare; there is actually a plentiful supply of it in the cosmos. In
fact, 24 per cent of our galaxy’s elemental mass consists of helium, which makes it the
second most abundant element in our universe. Because of its lightness, however, most
helium vanished from our own planet many years ago. Consequently, only a miniscule
proportion – 0.00052%, to be exact – remains in earth’s atmosphere. Helium is the by-
product of millennia of radioactive decay from the elements thorium and uranium. The
helium is mostly trapped in subterranean natural gas bunkers and commercially
extracted through a method known as fractional distillation.
C
The loss of helium on Earth would affect society greatly. Defying the perception
of it as a novelty substance for parties and gimmicks, the element actually has many
vital applications in society. Probably the most well known commercial usage is in
airships and blimps (non-flammable helium replaced hydrogen as the lifting gas du jour
after the Hindenburg catastrophe in 1932, during which an airship burst into flames and
crashed to the ground killing some passengers and crew). But helium is also
instrumental in deep-sea diving, where it is blended with nitrogen to mitigate the dangers
of inhaling ordinary air under high pressure; as a cleaning agent for rocket engines; and,
in its most prevalent use, as a coolant for superconducting magnets in hospital MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging) scanners.
D
The possibility of losing helium forever poses the threat of a real crisis because
its unique qualities are extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible to duplicate (certainly, no
biosynthetic ersatz product is close to approaching the point of feasibility for helium,
even as similar developments continue apace for oil and coal). Helium is even cheerfully
derided as a “loner” element since it does not adhere to other molecules like its cousin,
hydrogen. According to Dr. Lee Sobotka, helium is the “most noble of gases, meaning
it’s very stable and non-reactive for the most part ... it has a closed electronic
11configuration, a very tightly bound atom. It is this coveting of its own electrons that
prevents combination with other elements’. Another important attribute is helium’s
unique boiling point, which is lower than that for any other element. The worsening
global shortage could render millions of dollars of high-value, life-saving equipment
totally useless. The dwindling supplies have already resulted in the postponement of
research and development projects in physics laboratories and manufacturing plants
around the world. There is an enormous supply and demand imbalance partly brought
about by the expansion of high-tech manufacturing in Asia.
E
The source of the problem is the Helium Privatisation Act (HPA), an American
law passed in 1996 that requires the U.S. National Helium Reserve to liquidate its helium
assets by 2015 regardless of the market price. Although intended to settle the original
cost of the reserve by a U.S. Congress ignorant of its ramifications, the result of this fire
sale is that global helium prices are so artificially deflated that few can be bothered
recycling the substance or using it judiciously. Deflated values also mean that natural
gas extractors see no reason to capture helium. Much is lost in the process of extraction.
As Sobotka notes: "[t]he government had the good vision to store helium, and the
question now is: Will the corporations have the vision to capture it when extracting
natural gas, and consumers the wisdom to recycle? This takes long-term vision because
present market forces are not sufficient to compel prudent practice”. For Nobel-prize
laureate Robert Richardson, the U.S. government must be prevailed upon to repeal its
privatisation policy as the country supplies over 80 per cent of global helium, mostly from
the National Helium Reserve. For Richardson, a twenty- to fifty-fold increase in prices
would provide incentives to recycle.
F
A number of steps need to be taken in order to avert a costly predicament in the
coming decades. Firstly, all existing supplies of helium ought to be conserved and
released only by permit, with medical uses receiving precedence over other commercial
or recreational demands. Secondly, conservation should be obligatory and enforced by a
regulatory agency. At the moment some users, such as hospitals, tend to recycle
diligently while others, such as NASA, squander massive amounts of helium. Lastly,
research into alternatives to helium must begin in earnest.',
